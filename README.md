# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied Conditionally

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where classes are not applied conditionally when a component's content changes.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when using Tailwind CSS classes within a component that renders content conditionally (e.g., based on a prop or state). In certain scenarios, the Tailwind classes may not be applied, resulting in the default styles being shown.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the behavior of the component; sometimes classes are applied, other times not.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind's JIT mode is correctly configured and that the conditional rendering logic doesn't interfere with Tailwind's class application.  The solution provided correctly applies Tailwind CSS classes even under conditional rendering scenarios.
